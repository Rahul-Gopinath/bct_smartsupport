Description:
    This script implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that uses
    local text documents as knowledge base and queries them with OpenAI's language 
    models. It persistently stores a vector index (Chroma) to speed up repeated runs 
    by avoiding re-processing documents unless explicitly requested.

Usage:
    python3 chatbot.py [-reindexing yes|no]

    Options:
    -reindexing yes  Rebuild the vector index from local documents, even if a saved index exists.
    -reindexing no   Load existing vector index if available, else build it (default).

Requirements:
    - Python 3.9+
    - Set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable before running.
    - Install required packages: langchain, langchain-community, langchain-openai, etc.

This script handles:
    - Loading .txt documents from ./data/
    - Splitting documents into chunks for embedding
    - Creating or loading a persistent Chroma vector store
    - Using OpenAI embeddings and ChatOpenAI models from langchain
    - Command-line parameter parsing for flexible re-indexing

Note:
    For security, avoid hardcoding API keys; prefer environment variables.
    The script is designed for local MacOS usage but is cross-platform compatible.
